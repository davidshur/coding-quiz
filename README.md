# Homework 3 - Random Password Generator
This is a quiz that you can take in order to test your programming knowledge.

Application is responsive due to bootstrap. jQuery was also used in the making of this project.

## Installation
Since I only used links and HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and jQuery all you need to do to run my site locally, is clone it!

## Usage
The quiz is timed and the time remaining when you finish the quiz will be your score. Be careful though, if you answer a question incorrectly, you will lose 15 seconds from your time!

Additionally you can save your highscore to local storage after you're done, so that you can remember how smart you are forever...

Website is fully responsive on different screen sizes!
